🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis
SQL • DAX • Power BI

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis workflow using pizza sales data.
The goal is to analyze sales performance, customer ordering behavior, and revenue distribution,
and to communicate insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The project covers the complete analytical pipeline:
SQL for data analysis, DAX for business metrics, and
Power BI for visualization and reporting.

🎯 Project Objectives

The analysis focuses on answering the following business questions:

What is the total revenue and total number of orders?

What is the average order value and pizzas per order?

How do sales trends vary by day and month?

Which pizzas generate the highest and lowest sales and revenue?

Which pizza categories and sizes contribute most to revenue?

The objective is not only to build charts, but to extract actionable business insights from data.
